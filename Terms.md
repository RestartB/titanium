## Features
We are developing Titanium to add new features and remove bugs all the time. Because of this, new features may be added and some features may be removed. By using Titanium, you acknowledge this fact and that we are not responsible for any lost data or features.

## Outages
Titanium may experience temporary outages in service, whether this is due to maintenance, feature rollouts or other issues. By using Titanium, you acknowledge this fact and that we are not responsible for any lost time or data due to an outage.

## Third Party Services
Titanium relies on several third party services. By using features that rely on these services, you agree to their policies. Below is a list of these services, provided for your convenience, accurate as of the release date of this policy:
- [Discord](https://discord.com/terms)
- [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/legal/end-user-agreement/)

## Service Termination
By using Titanium, you agree that we have the right to terminate your service at any time, with or without notice, for any reason. When this happens, you will not be allowed to run any commands with Titanium, use Titanium context menu items, or interact with Titanium in any other way. We will do this one of two ways:
- **Per User Termination:** if one user is violating the terms of service, we will blacklist the user from accessing Titanium's services.
- **Server Termination:** if an entire Discord server is violating the terms of service, we will blacklist the server from being able to use Titanium's services. The bot will be kicked from the server and will automatically leave if someone attempts to add it back.

## Policy Updates
We may make changes to this policy over time. If a major change is made to the Terms of Service policy, we will make an announcement over public channels.

## Contact Us
If you wish to contact us, please join the [support Discord server](https://discord.gg/FKc8gZUmhM), then create a ticket. We will attempt to get back to you ASAP regarding your concern.
