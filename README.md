## Self Hosting Titanium
Self-hosting Titanium is possible, however you must get the required modules and API tokens first.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> While I have taken every precaution to block offensive content from being displayed without a disclaimer, it is your responsibility as the bot host to monitor for any offensive content being posted using the bot.

> [!CAUTION]
> When generating Bot Tokens and API Secrets, do not share them with anybody!

### Discord Bot Token
Titanium requires a Discord Bot Token to function. The steps to get one are as follows:
1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and log in with your Discord Account.
2. Create a new application and fill in the information required.
3. Go to the `Bot` section, and generate a new bot.
4. Give your bot a username, and optionally, a PFP and banner.
5. Copy the Bot Token, and paste it into the bot token field in the config file. Due to security reasons, you will only be able to view the bot token once from Discord Developer Portal before having to generate a new one.

### Spotify API Key
To use the Spotify commands in Titanium, a Spotify Client ID and Secret are required. If you do not provide these, Spotify commands will automatically be disabled. The steps to get these are as follows:
1. Go to the [Spotify Developers dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard). A free or premium Spotify account is required.
2. Create a new app, set the app name and description to whatever you please.  No additional APIs are required.
3. Set the Redirect URI to any valid URL. `http://example.com` is known to work. Then, create the app.
4. Copy the Client ID and Secret for your app, and paste them into their respective fields in the config file.

### Python Modules
Titanium relies on several Python packages. The recommended way to install these packages is with `pipenv`. A `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` have been provided, see the instructions below to use it:\
\
**Installation**
1. Run `pip install pipenv --user` to install pipenv
2. Open a terminal inside Titanium's root directory
3. Run `pipenv install` to install all required packages
4. Run `pipenv run python main.py` to start the bot

If an error occurs, please create a GitHub issue and I will take a look.

### Generating a Bot Invite
To invite your instance of Titanium to your server, an invite is required. You can use the following template to make a bot invite URL:\
`https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=(YOUR CLIENT ID)&permissions=1689814080810048`\
You will need your Discord Client ID to make this URL. You can get this from the General Information page of your Application you generated earlier in Discord Developer Portal.

## Included Cogs
Titanium also includes some non command cogs, which are also stored in the command folder. The list is below:
- **spotify_autoembed.py**
  - Stores the event handler for Spotify Auto-embedding.
- **status_update.py**
  - Stores the autoupdater for the bot's activity status.

## Developing your own Cogs
Titanium is modular and will load compatible cogs automatically.

### Cogs Path
The default cogs path is:\
`(RUNNING-PATH)/commands`.\
This path can be changed to a path of your selection in the config file.

### Example Cog
I have developed an example cog that you can look at and modify to fit your needs. You can find it in `example.py`. When you are ready to use the cog, place it in your cogs folder (`/commands` by default).
